- **How to use** This is a tool to change seats. I made this because it was quite a hassle when we changed seats at school today. It also serves as a practice for cloning. The number of students and seat assignments are based on the standard Japanese elementary and junior high school system of 40(students)=8(students)*5(rows), but I will try to make a different version. There is no consideration for gender.
- **Note** It is a pleasure to create such works of art from time to time.
